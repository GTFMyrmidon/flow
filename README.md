#### Vision
---
A smarter degree auditing system, created by students for students.

#### What is it?
---
Flow is a new and improved way for students to audit their degrees. The user will be presented with a flowchart-like visual composed of all the requirements that their degree demands and have a way of tracking which classes they've completed and which still remain. 

#### Motivation
---
The current degree audit is visually unappealing and difficult to navigate. We believe that having a tool that allows students to get a clearer picture of what courses they still need to take will in turn allow them to better set up they're future schedules.

#### Risks
---
1. New languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
2. Time constraint
3. No prior experience with web design

#### Requirements

3. As a student, I would like my own personal account to record my progress, thus I can revisit and reexamine my audit. Sizing Value: 8
4. As a student, I would like to manipulate the color, font, size of the flowchart to personalize the Webpage to my own desire.. Sizing Value: 5

5. As a developer,I would like to store a username and password to allow the user to save his/her progress.  Sizing Value: 8
6. As a developer, I would like to have a customer database, a database filled with required courses to fulfill the degree requirements. Sizing Value: 8
7. As a developer, I would like to allow the user to distinguish completed courses and available options to fulfill the degree requirements. Sizing Value: 3

8. As a developer, I would like to have a protection system enacting prevention measures to safeguard login information and user accounts. Sizing Value: 13
9. As a developer, I would like to develop efficient lines of code to generate a fast and reliable Webpage. Maneuvering through the Webpage should be achieved at high speeds. Sizing Value: 8
10. As a developer, I would like to have the Webpage be Mobile-Friendly to allow accessibility to accounts separate from Desktop Computers, allowing different types of devices to receive flexible framework. Sizing Value: 5

#### Methodology
---
We will be following the Agile methodology.
---
  NOTE: Agile means that the iterations is key. A time span where we need to work on part of the project and try to complete it. 
    NOTE: We began to follow other Methodologies.
      Crytals Methods Methodology: This was used for sometime. Because we each excelled in different areas we took that oppurtunity to use our skills in different areas. 
#### Project Tracking Software

We will use Gitlo to sync our Trello cards with our github repo.
