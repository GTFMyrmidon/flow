#### Vision
---
A smarter degree auditing system built by students, for students.

#### What is it?
---
Flow is a new and improved way for students to audit their degrees. The user will be presented with a flowchart-like visual composed of all the requirements that their degree demands and have a way of tracking which classes they've completed and which still remain. 

#### Motivation
---
The current degree audit is visually unappealing and difficult to navigate. We believe that having a tool that allows students to get a clearer picture of what courses they still need to take will in turn allow them to better set up they're future schedules.

#### Risks
---
1. New languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
2. Time constraint
3. No prior experience with web design
