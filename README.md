#### Vision
---
A smarter degree auditing system built by students, for students.

#### What is it?
---
Flow is a new and improved way for students to audit their degrees. The user will be presented with a flowchart-like visual composed of all the requirements that their degree demands and have a way of tracking which classes they've completed and which still remain. 

#### Motivation
---
Adding classes through myCUinfo is clunky. It is difficult to visualize what you schedule will look like (i.e., where your classes are and whether or not you will have time to move from class to class, where are there gaps in between classes, seeing when classes will cause scheduling conflicts, etc.). The degree audit through DARSweb is only in text, and it can sometimes be cumbersome to see 

#### Risks
---
*New languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
*Time constraint
